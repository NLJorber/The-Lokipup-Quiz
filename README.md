# Quiz

Welcome to The Lokipup Quiz!

This is a mutlti-choice quiz centred around my dog, Loki. It's intended to be a novelty quiz that gives the user information about him as they answer 5 questions. 

This quiz was created using two different youtube tutorials: 

this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBcqGxrr9g8&t=369s 

and this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp8x8-reqZA&t=1252s 

The first video was used to get the quiz application itself running, the second I used early sections of to be able to create a homepage and create a starting point for the quiz to appear, and also close once finished. I stitched the two parts together by ensuring the code I used for the first half matched the code I used in the second section, and tried to ensure it didn't clash or create redundancies. I added styling details such as a google font, a background page with a graduated fade to allow the text to display clearly, and a popup with a photo at the end as a reward for finishing the quiz. I used complementary colours through the design that work well with the background image. I also created a little logo in Canva and added it to the header of the homepage. The layout maintains its integrity at different sizes.
